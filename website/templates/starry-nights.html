                    Starting with a primary focus on the Star Gazing Club (SGE) at NITK—one of the oldest and most 
                    storied clubs on campus—our Starry Night sessions have grown into signature, eye-catching events. 
                    We organise regular observing nights throughout the year around noteworthy celestial happenings 
                    (meteor showers, planetary alignments, eclipses and seasonal constellations), each offering guided 
                    telescope viewings, short talks, and hands-on demonstrations. The sessions welcome everyone from 
                    curious beginners to experienced skywatchers, teaching constellation navigation, basic astrophotography, 
                    and safe telescope use while fostering a friendly community of space enthusiasts. We also document and 
                    share highlights from every session, building a visual archive of the cosmos and the club’s discoveries.

                    Starry nights sessions are one of the main attractions during the annual tech fest of the institute – Engineer 
                    in the odd semester and the cultural fest – Incident in the even semester. Starry nights on these events attract 
                    a lot of sky gazing amateurs to witness the beauty of cosmos through the lens in magnificent way, to experience 
                    the brilliant bright stars. Not restricting to institute level events, we also organize multiple starry night 
                    sessions on rare astronomical events like planet’s parade, lunar eclipse and much more – from the sunspots in 
                    daylight to the brightest stars and planets in the night sky, captured through telescopes.
